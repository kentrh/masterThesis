\chapter*{Abstract}
As news consumption is shifting towards the digital domain, with mobile devices in particular, mobile news applications are becoming increasingly popular.

This thesis focuses on a combination of mobile applications, with the use of recommender systems, in a news application's perspective, by identifying the state of mobile news applications available today and analyzing how they are accomplished, as well as developing a mobile news recommender application, as a use case associated with this project to see how this can be realized from a developer's perspective.

Most of the commercial applications examined in this project follows a similar design pattern concerning user interfaces and user interaction, but there are some that breaks with this trend. The use of personalization and recommendation techniques as an underlying technology for news applications are becoming more wide spread, especially the use of active personalization making use of implicit user feedback.
