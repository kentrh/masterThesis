\chapter*{Preface}

This report holds the work carried out in my master thesis as part of my Master of Science degree at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The topic chosen for this thesis was based on my personal interest in mobile application design and development, as well as a genuine curiosity towards trending technologies and applications.

I would like to thank my supervisors Professor Jon Atle Gulla at the Department of Computer and Information Science, NTNU and Erik Berg at Telenor for the guidance and valuable feedback throughout the project.

I also wish to thank my fianc√© for her patience and support, considering we both are continuously juggling studies, work and parenting our one year old daughter.
