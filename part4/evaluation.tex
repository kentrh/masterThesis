\chapter{Evaluation}


%As of now, most native mobile news application are created by third parties without any agreements with the content publishers, resulting in more web perspectives than full article perspectives.

%It is illegal to scrape a news article and present it as is, but it is not illegal to scrape a news article and create a summary by the use of NLP, machine learning and other text processing technologies and present it at will.


%Evaluate the table comparing the different application and try to sort them into two or three different types of applications.

%Some of the mobile news applications presented in section \ref{commercial_news_applications} are also available as web applications, but there are very few, if any, native desktop applications that serve news in the same manner as the mobile news applications. As the most popular desktop operating systems, like Windows 8 and OS X Lion both provide their own application stores for desktop application, similar to the ones seen on mobile devices, a shifting trend towards native desktop applications may happen in the future, and native news applications may see the light.
